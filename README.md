# Retail Sales Predictor

This project focuses on predicting retail item sales using machine learning techniques. The dataset is based on sales data from various outlets of a retail chain. The goal is to predict `Item_Outlet_Sales`, which represents the sales of products at different stores.

## Project Overview

* **Domain**: Retail / E-commerce
* **Problem Type**: Regression
* **ML Algorithm Used**: XGBoost Regressor
* **Key Steps**: Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Label Encoding, Model Training, Evaluation

## Dataset

The dataset used is from BigMart and includes features such as:

* Item characteristics (e.g., weight, type, MRP)
* Outlet characteristics (e.g., size, location, type)
* Target: `Item_Outlet_Sales`

The training data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/IpshitaBiswas/Retail-Sales-Predictor/blob/main/Train.csv).

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Seaborn & Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**

   * Load CSV file from GitHub using pandas.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

   * Basic statistics using `.describe()` and `.info()`
   * Data visualization with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`

3. **Handling Missing Values**

   * Imputed `Item_Weight` using mean.
   * Imputed `Outlet_Size` using mode grouped by `Outlet_Type`.

4. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Standardized inconsistent labels (e.g., `low fat`, `LF` → `Low Fat`)
   * Label encoded categorical features using `LabelEncoder`.

5. **Feature-Target Split**

   * Features: All columns except `Item_Outlet_Sales`
   * Target: `Item_Outlet_Sales`

6. **Model Training**

   * Used `XGBRegressor` for training
   * Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets

7. **Evaluation Metrics**

   * R-squared score on training and test data

## Results

* **Training R² Score**: High (indicative of good model fit)
* **Testing R² Score**: Slightly lower (evaluates generalization ability)
